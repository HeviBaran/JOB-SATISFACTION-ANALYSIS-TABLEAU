# Job Satisfaction Analysis - Tableau Project


# This analysis has been done for indicating the effects of job satisfaction of employees on the sales of the  company

### Objectives

1-Display the profile of the employees by the age, gender and education level
2-Create a visual composition about the job satisfaction of current employees
3-Discuss about how to improve the job satisfaction 


### Conclusion

After all review of the employees' datas and the survey result we can say that;
* Current position and education level seems correlated but on the other hand there is an inconsistancy between the income and job role,
* The employees' distribution according to the gender and age is correlated and also the average of working time at the position is 4, which shows us the satisfaction is really good!
* Attrition rate is only %16 percent and this is very understandable rate in average!
